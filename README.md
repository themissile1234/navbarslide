Digimeg - A jQuery Based Mega Menu
======================================
It is a simple mega menu that was created to be implemented in one of my projects. I decided to make it open source so that it may help any one out there :-)

For the detail of how to use, look for the comments inside each of the files.

##Todo

- Make the Main menu item stay active ( keep the style as in hovered state ) when the sub nav of that menu item is visible
- The javascript needs to be in modular pattern, which in the current state isn't
